# Joule-Thief-Lamp
A Joule thief is a simple, compact circuit designed to draw power from low-voltage sources, often extending the usable life of batteries. It operates as a boost converter, capable of stepping up low voltage (as little as 0.3V from a near-dead battery) to a higher voltage sufficient to power devices like LEDs.
